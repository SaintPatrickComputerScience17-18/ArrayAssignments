# ArrayAssignments

## For Loops and Arrays
From the worksheet, type and test out your code to see that each example completes its required task.  You may add addition tests in the main function if you want.

## Extra Challenge
Create four additional arrays creative named first, second, third, and fourth.  First and second are lists of 5 numbers.
  -  Use a for-loop to fill the third array with the sum of the items in the first and second array.
  -  After you are done working with the third array, the fourth array should first copy the items from the first array amd when it is done, continue copying the elements in the second array.
  -  That means that the third array should have a length of 5 and the fourth array should have a length of 10.
